# Utilizing Social Styles for Communication at Remote Work

Every individual possesses distinct social traits and viewpoints, contributing to a diverse array of thoughts and understandings. In the context of remote work, as communication methods shift towards greater asynchrony, the uniqueness of these social traits often fades into the background. Messages received are processed through the lens of one's own social style, neglecting the understanding of others' perspectives. Similarly, when composing messages or emails, individuals tend to express themselves according to their own social style, without considering how the recipient might interpret the message. The concept of Social Styles, developed by industrial psychologists David Merrill and Roger Reid in the early 1960s, delves into observable behavior, defining it as "you that's on display." This model explores assertiveness and responsiveness, categorizing individuals into four social styles: Analytical, Driving, Expressive, and Amiable [\[5\]](https://www.pocketbook.co.uk/blog/2017/04/18/david-merrill-roger-reid-social-styles/).

1. **Analytical Style:** This style emphasizes asking over telling and exhibits high emotional control. Valuing facts, logic, and accuracy, it is disciplined and unemotional, with a deep need to be right. The weakness lies in hesitating to state a position until certainty is achieved.
   
2. **Driving Style:** Task-oriented and result-driven, the driving style prefers telling over asking, often sacrificing personal relationships for efficiency. Fast-paced and decision-oriented, its weakness is an unwillingness to listen and accommodate others.
   
3. **Expressive Style:** Assertive and emotionally driven, the expressive style relies on gut instinct for decision-making. Charismatic and idealistic at its best, it can be perceived as impulsive and manipulative at its worst.
   
4. **Amiable Style:** Expressing concern for people, the amiable style prioritizes relationship-building. Slow-paced and deliberate, it is sensitive, supportive, and dependable. However, a resistance to change and low willingness to initiate action are weaknesses.

Understanding these social styles allows for the strategic deployment of versatility in accommodating diverse communication and collaboration preferences. By utilizing this model, individuals can gain valuable insights into tailoring interactions to specific social styles, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of communication and collaboration, especially in the unique challenges posed by remote work settings. This approach ensures a more nuanced and adaptive engagement within diverse social contexts, ultimately addressing and resolving challenges associated with remote work communication and collaboration. The enhancement of communication stems from Social Style, as it allows us to comprehend personal behavioral preferences and stressors, which form the basis of all comfortable and challenging relationships [\[12\]].

## Artificial Intelligence at Workplace

In November 2022, OpenAI achieved a breakthrough in the field of Generative Artificial Intelligence by introducing a Large Language Model (LLM) known as ChatGPT. This AI model surpassed its predecessors in intelligence, demonstrating an enhanced ability to comprehend context and generate information [\[8\]]. LLM models have found substantial utility in professional settings as well. As outlined in an article from MIT Sloan titled “How generative AI can boost highly skilled workers’ productivity” [\[7\]], research indicates that within its defined capabilities, artificial intelligence has the potential to enhance worker performance by up to 40%, surpassing the productivity of those who do not leverage it. Furthermore, LLMs have exhibited their capacity to revolutionize communication. Models like ChatGPT, which are trained on a lot of information already knowns social styles, can be further personalized for teams by employing the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique [\[9\]]. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) involves optimizing the output of a large language model by referencing an authoritative knowledge base beyond its training data sources before generating a response. In our case, this knowledge base will encompass the social styles of each team member and the best practices for communication tailored to different social styles. The knowledge base will also encompass a matrix illustrating alterations in effective communication practices among different social styles, sourced from [\[10\]].

## Implementation Strategy

To harness the power of social styles effectively within our team, strategic implementation is crucial. It is imperative that all team members are well-informed about their social styles and recognize the value of incorporating these styles to enhance communication with their teammates. By integrating Social Styles with the capabilities of AI, I advocate for a novel approach to enhance communication within our remote workspace:

1. **Raise Awareness:** Create awareness about social traits, various social styles, and emphasize different communication styles.
   
2. **Social Style Assessment:** Utilize Social Style Assessment to identify the social style of each team member.
   
3. **Self-Reflection:** Encourage employees to discuss their social styles identified through assessments and prompt them to reflect on their self-perception versus the indicated social style.
   
4. **Analyzing Team’s Collective Communication Style:** Analyze team members' communication styles. Do analysis on the basis of Diversity of social style, potential challenges, best communication strategy, meeting dynamics for remote meetings.
   
5. **Knowledgebase Development:** Build a knowledgebase for the model using the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique [\[9\]]. Essentially, inform the model about each team member's specific social styles.
   
6. **AI-Powered Suggestions:** Implement AI to suggest communication strategies when one employee sends a message/email to another, taking into account the sender's and receiver's social styles.
   
7. **Feedback and Improvement:** Conduct a follow-up meeting after one semester (6 months) to collect feedback, facilitate open discussions, and utilize the input to enhance and refine the system.

This comprehensive approach combines self-awareness, targeted training, and AI assistance to foster effective communication tailored to individual social styles among remote employees.

The High-level view with example illustrates how the chatbot will work.

## Discussion & Challenges

AI offers a convenient method for adjusting one's social style, alleviating the need for employees to constantly consider the social styles of their teammates. By allowing AI to manage communication nuances, employees can focus on their tasks, ensuring polished communication. The integration of a social style coach, such as a chatbot, into daily activities can significantly enhance workplace communication, reducing friction as previously highlighted. This approach facilitates the adaptation of communication styles, promoting effectiveness. Alternatively, seamlessly incorporating this intelligent chatbot into communication platforms like Microsoft Teams, Zoom, and Slack streamlines message updates and provides real-time suggestions, enhancing overall communication efficiency.

### Advantages of the Integrated AI-powered Social Style Coach:

1. **Efficiency Improvement:** Streamlining communication through AI integration enhances overall efficiency in workplace interactions.
   
2. **Friction Reduction:** By minimizing the need for employees to manually consider social styles, the chatbot helps reduce friction and miscommunications.
   
3. **Adaptability:** The chatbot assists employees in adapting their communication style to align with the preferences of the recipient, fostering more effective exchanges.
   
4. **Real-time Suggestions:** Integration with communication platforms allows for instant feedback and suggestions, promoting continuous improvement in communication skills.
   
5. **Enhanced Productivity:** With the chatbot handling communication nuances, employees can focus more on their work, leading to increased productivity.

The implementation of AI systems may encounter resistance from employees, particularly regarding privacy concerns. AI models like GPT face challenges related to hallucination, wherein LLM models generate content that is not contextually relevant. In a remote workplace setting, this could lead to increased miscommunication. However, this drawback can be addressed by iteratively refining
